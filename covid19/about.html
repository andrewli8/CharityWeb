        <p>Community Care streamlines the process of obtaining resources for hospitals and aid organizations, thereby increasing access to necessary resources.</p> 
        <br>
        <p>We connect potential donors and businesses to these organizations according to what the former have and the latter need. Donors and businesses can sort by the urgency of the request, distance to the dropoff point, specific type of resource, organization, and a number of other factors.</p>
